This is a small proof-of-concept application that retrieves data from one of the public REST services provided by SAP as a demo of the SAP NetWeaver Gateway 2.0. The application is built in Javascript, and uses JQueryMobile and PhoneGap to be able to run on the iPhone (and any other platform where PhoneGap is supported)

The repository contains the code for the application as well as the Xcode project needed to build the application.
